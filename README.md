## My process

### Built with

-   Vite (https://vitejs.dev/)
-   ReactJS (https://react.dev)
-   Sass/Scss (https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

Little bigger React Project then the last one, using useState and useEffect.

used useEffect to montior for window Resize events, to display either either the Desktop- or the Mobile Version of the Main Article Picture, depending on current screen Size.

Also moved the Content to a .json file to import and simulate an outside data source / Backend.
Which was not part of the Challenge but felt like the right thing for this Project.
